[**Rundown**]

This github repository displays a functioning web game utilising JavaScript

[**Layout**]

General layout of Website is based in folders. Each is linked to when necessary within the confines of the HTML framework.
General look of website is controlled via css.

[**JavaScript**]
The game is performed through the use of JavaScript. 
The classes and methods are all within the one JS file (game.js). This is not ideal, but with time this may be changed.
